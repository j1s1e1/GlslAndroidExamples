GlslAndroidExamples
===================

Tests of GLSL functions with Android Studio

These files were based on C tutorials at http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html developed by Jason L. McKesson.
I had completed most of the conversions to C# and Android, then I had a really bad hard drive crash, and I am in the 
process of recreating the conversions from damaged files.

As of 09Sep14, these files run on Android Studio Beta 0.8.2.  Although updates have improved, typically the project 
breaks every time there is an update to the tools.

I don't expect anyone will really be interested in this, I just filled this out in case someone finds this 
project searching for examples.
